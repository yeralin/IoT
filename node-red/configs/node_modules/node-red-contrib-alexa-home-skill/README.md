# node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill

This node allows you to hook up Node-RED to react to your Amazon Echo.

By using the Home Skill patern you can use commands like 

"Alexa, turn on the Kitchen Lights" and have this trigger a Node-RED flow.

In order to use this node you will require an account with 
[this](https://alexa-node-red.bm.hardill.me.uk/) service. Once you have 
an account you can search for the Node-RED skill in the Alexa app and then 
link the account.

Full documentation to set up the service can be found 
[here](https://alexa-node-red.bm.hardill.me.uk/docs).

## Install

```
cd $HOME/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-alexa-home-skill
```
